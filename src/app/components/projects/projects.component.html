                <ul>
                  <li>Took charge of designing and implementing a new feature from scratch to create user views based on the selected properties/metadata of any record. Properties of Records include Record Title, Date Created, Unique Identifier etc.</li>
                  <li>Contributed in doing the POC to design the backend for the feature using the concepts of singleton and factory design patterns by following the REST API standards and SOLID principles. </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed REST API endpoints using Java and Spring Boot by interacting with C++ team to gather the parameters required to create the APIs.
                  </li>
                  <li>Design and developed the front end of this feature from scratch using Typescript and Knockout JS and calling the endpoints wherever necessary for proper working of the feature. Authentication was also taken care of while adding the endpoints to front end code.

                <ul>
                  <li>Onedrive Integration is feature of the product which enables the user to edit any documents online by automatically uploading to onedrive and edit a file. Earlier few file types were allowed to edit in using this integration which is now being handled to support any file types.</li>
                  <li>Implemented few REST API endpoints using Java and Spring Boot by modifying the existing code and using the SDKs which are written in C# for interaction with Azure. </li>
                  <li>
                    Tested the feature for all the file types and the result was 100% accurate, which got appreciations from the customers.

                <h4>HackWeek 2022 | Microservices</h4>
                <h5>Microfocus (OpenText), Bangalore</h5>
                <p><em>Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, Netflix Eureka, gRPC, PostgreSQL, RedisDB</em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Participated in a two-week hackathon event within the company and spearheaded the proof of concept (POC) for refactoring the monolithic model of the Records and Location module into a microservices architecture.
                </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed two microservices using Spring Boot and Core Java concepts, one for record registration and the other for location registration. Both microservices are registered to the Eureka server for service discovery. Implemented an API Gateway, also registered to the Eureka server, for accessing the microservices.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enabled inter-microservice communication through gRPC calls. Protocol buffers were written and compiled using the protoc compiler to generate Java code models for message passing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Utilized Redis DB as a cache to store frequently accessed data. This approach reduces latency by retrieving data from Redis cache instead of querying the PostgreSQL database for subsequent requests.

                <li>
                  Ensured robust security using Spring Security for role based access control and structured the project with Spring Boot's multi-module approach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integrated Twilioâ€™s SMS free service to send notifications to end-users for a successful transaction and OTPs.
